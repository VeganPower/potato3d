# Potato 3D
Project to compare and study a rasterizer a raytracer and 3d accelerated renderer (openGL).

Early stage of develop. Basically is a simple app that create a scene (load an obj), then should potentially render the scene with a raytracer, a (software) rasterizer and openGL. Possible development can be to use some compute shader to speed up some algorithm.

Is a learning project because it's a lot of time that I don't write a rasterizer.
